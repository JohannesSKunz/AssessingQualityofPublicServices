## Overview 

This repository contains replication files and data for [Kunz, Propper, Staub, and Winkelmann (2024)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hec.4861); more details can be found in the paper. 

The analysis is based on external restricted datasets that we do not re-post here since they are held by different entities. 

Here, we describe how to access them and provide our codes. We encourage any replication attempt, and interested readers should not hesitate to contact [Johannes Kunz](mailto:johannes.kunz@monash.edu) about any of these. For brevity, we also exclude the multitude of replication files for the Appendix version but are happy to provide these upon request. 

## Replication do-files 

Here, we collect the do-file used in our analysis. We do not repost the dataset as it is proprietary, which approved access, and the dofile of all main results should be replicable. Please let us know if you encounter any issues. 

After adjusting the path, all main results in the paper should be replicated after running the respective codes; please let us know if you encounter any issues or have any questions regarding these. 

Our novel quality metrics can be used from the main data set; if readers aim to calculate their own quality metrics from binary-longitudinal information, refer to [brfeglm](https://github.com/JohannesSKunz/brfeglm), do not hesitate to contact us in case you need any support with this. 

## Data access

All datasets are publicly available, and the paper's appendix provides information on which data has been used. The do-files in the _dodata folder show how the data is used.
